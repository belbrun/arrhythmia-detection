# Arrythmia Detection and Diagnosis

Master's Thesis project consisting of two subprojects:
- arrythmia detection and
- arrythmia diagnosis
 
Both sub-projects use a Machine Learning approach to classify parts of ECG recordings and gain informations about a patients hearthbeat.
Two seperate databases are used to make to differently defined problems. Similar approach is used in solving both problems, defining an SVM baseline and multiple RNN main models.
Training, validation and evalution were conducted, and model parameters are saved and uploaded to the repository for the purpuse of result reproduction.
Runner modules in each subproject use similar model definition syntax and training sessions are logged and the logs are saved.

Libraries used in both subprojects are:
- pytorch
- numpy
- sklearn

Information about each subproject can be found on its individual branch, detection and diagnosis.
